ReloadSkin plugin
-----------------
This plugin can be used during the skin development.
When active, it provides two hotkeys for reloading screen contents:

F3  - Reload the current screen
F4  - Reload the saved skin/theme
F12 - Save current skin/theme

With that plugin in action, you can develop a theme or screens while MP2 is
running. Navigate into the appropriate theme/screen folder and change the files,
them press F3 or F4 to reload the contents.

The ScreenManager automatically falls back to the default skin/default theme
if there is a problem with the current theme or with the current screen in the
current skin. To avoid the fallback, you can stick to the current skin/theme
by pressing F12.
