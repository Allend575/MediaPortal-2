## Shared team settings for ReSharper

This directory contains the shared team settings for ReSharper including the __Team MediaPortal__ code style definition.
The ``MediaPortal.sln.DotSettings`` is referenced by all VisualStudio solution files (*.sln) within the MP2 repository.
The reference was created according to http://stackoverflow.com/a/14896788.

Any modifications to the file needs to be reported back to the whole team in forums, so it can be applied to other repositories as well.

__Any__ new solution within the repository also need a DotSettings file right from the start (__first commit__), which refers to the shared style definition.
