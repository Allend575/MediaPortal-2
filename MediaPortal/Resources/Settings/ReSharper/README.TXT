For the development of MediaPortal 2, we use VisualStudio. Most of our developers use ReSharper (R#) from JetBrains.
That is a tool which provides very useful functions like code formatting, templates, code navigation help and so on.

To have similar settings among the developers, I've put my current ReSharper settings here. If you want, you
can apply my settings in your environment.

Unfortunately, ReSharper doesn't provide an Im-/Export function for the settings, so you have to copy
the settings file manually in your file system.

The path in file system is
C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Roaming\JetBrains\ReSharper\v5.1\vs10.0\UserSettings.xml
where 5.1 is my installed ReSharper version and VS 10.0 is my installed VisualStudio version. I don't know if it is possible
to mix settings files from different versions.
