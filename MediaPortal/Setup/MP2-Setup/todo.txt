On a fresh install, going to custom, changing a path and returning in
a "simple" installation mode uses the customized paths... is it wanted ? Maybe a point to check


-----   DONE     ----- why can I see a "install from network" for the others "paths" than plugins ? Is it relly needed ?

- Remains to make a check on the "remote rerrources" paths to be certain it's on a NTFS drive or MP2 will faill, it's a prerequisite

-----   DONE     ----- On the "modify" screen, we can see the components used for custom paths are not
-----   DONE     ----- installed. Maybe they should include at least a dummy registry key or something to be seen as installed.

- In the TODO, is there a "on uninstall, give the choise to remove all directories created by MP2, like logs, database, etc..." ?

- Last comment is : there is still bugs in MP2 lol. I just found in some case,
- when customizing the database path, the server part crash... But it's not your fault, it's Daniel one lol. I'll bug report it sooner.
